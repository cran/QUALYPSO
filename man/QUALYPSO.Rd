\usage{
QUALYPSO(Y, scenAvail, vecYears = NULL, indexReferenceYear = NULL,
  indexFutureYear = NULL, listOption = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{matrix \code{nS} x \code{nY} or array \code{nG} x \code{nS} x \code{nY} of climate projections}

\item{scenAvail}{matrix of available combinations \code{nS} x \code{nEff}. The number of characteristics \code{nEff} corresponds to the
number of main effects which will be included in the ANOVA model.}

\item{vecYears}{(optional) vector of years corresponding to the projections (e.g. \code{vecYears=2001:2100}. Optional,
mainly used for records. By default, a vector \code{1:nY} is created.}

\item{indexReferenceYear}{(optional) index in \code{vecYears} corresponding to the control year. For example, if \code{vecYears=1980:2100}
and we want to specify a control year equals to 1990, we indicate \code{indexReferenceYear=11} or, equivalently \code{indexReferenceYear=which(vecYears==1990)}
\strong{if} \code{vecYears} is already available in the workspace}

\item{indexFutureYear}{index in \code{indexFutureYear} corresponding to a future year (similarly to \code{indexReferenceYear}). This index is necessary when
\code{Y} is an array \code{nG} x \code{nS} x \code{nY} available for \code{nG} grid points. Indeed, in this case, we run QUALYPSO only for one future year.}

\item{listOption}{(optional) list of options
\itemize{
  \item \strong{parSmooth}: smoothing parameter \code{spar} in \link[stats]{smooth.spline}: varies in [0,1]
  \item \strong{typeChangeVariable}: type of change variable: "abs" (absolute, value by default) or "rel" (relative)
  \item \strong{nBurn}: number of burn-in samples (default: 1000). If \code{nBurn} is too small, the convergence of MCMC chains might not be obtained.
  \item \strong{nKeep}: number of kept samples (default: 2000). If \code{nKeep} is too small, MCMC samples might not be represent correctly the posterior
  distributions of inferred parameters.
  \item \strong{nCluster}: number of clusters used for the parallelization (default: 1). When \code{nCluster} is greater than one, parallelization is used to
  apply \code{QUALYPSO} over multiple time steps or grid points simultaneously.
  \item \strong{doCompress}: logical, indicates if all the samples from the posterior distributions are stored (if FALSE)
  or if only quantiles are retrieved (if TRUE). Equals TRUE by default
  \item \strong{computeEmpEff}: vector of column indices in \code{scenAvail} corresponding to effects which are estimated empirically (e.g. interactions) when
  the number of available runs is not sufficient to identify / estimate these additional effects.
  \item \strong{quantileCompress}: vector of probabilities (in [0,1]) for which we compute the quantiles from the posterior distributions
   \code{quantileCompress = c(0.005,0.025,0.05,0.1,0.25,0.33,0.5,0.66,0.75,0.9,0.95,0.975,0.995)} by default
}}
}
\value{
list with the following fields:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{CLIMATEESPONSE}: list of climate change responses and corresponding internal variability. Contains \code{phiStar} (climate change responses),
  \code{etaStar} (deviation from the climate change responses as a result of internal variability), and \code{phi} (fitted climate responses)
  \item \strong{ANOVAPOST}: list of MCMC samples representing the posterior distributions of inferred quantities. \code{=NULL} if\code{listOption$doCompress=T}
  \item \strong{ANOVAQUANT}: list of quantiles from the posterior distributions of inferred quantities
  \item \strong{ANOVAMEAN}: list of mean of the posterior distributions of inferred quantities
  Each element contains the main effects (e.g. number of GCMs, RCMs, etc.)
  \item \strong{ANOVAVARIANCE}: matrix \code{nTypeEff} x \code{nY} of variances related to the main effects
  \item \strong{vecYears}: vector of years
  \item \strong{vecYearsANOVA}: vector of years for the ANOVA decomposition (start at \code{indexReferenceYear})
  \item \strong{Y}: matrix of available combinations given as inputs
  \item \strong{listOption}: list of options used to obtained these results (obtained from \code{\link{QUALYPSO.check.option}})
  \item \strong{listScenarioInput}: list of scenario characteristics (obtained from \code{\link{QUALYPSO.process.scenario}})

# RUN QUALYPSO
##########################################################################
# call main QUALYPSO function: two arguments are mandatory:
# - Y: Climate projections for nS scenarions and nY time steps. if Y is a matrix nS x nY, we
# run QUALYPSO nY times, for each time step. If Y is an array nG x nS x nY, for nG grid points,
# we run QUALYPSO nG times, for each grid point, for one time step specified using the argument
# indexFutureYear.
# - scenAvail: matrix or data.frame of available combinations nS x nEff. The number of
# characteristics nEff corresponds to the number of main effects which will be included in the
# ANOVA model. In the following example, we have nEff=2 main effects corresponding to the GCMs
# and RCMs.

# Many options can be specified in the argument "listOption". Here, we change the default values
# for nBurn and nKeep in order to speed up computation time for this small example. However, it must
# be noticed that convergence and sampling of the posterior distributions often require higher
# values for these two parameters.
